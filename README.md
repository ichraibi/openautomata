OpenAutomata
============


Python automata theory library. The goal of this project is to collect algorithms about Automata, Grammar, Regular Expressions and more. 

##Included


- Regular expressions: create NFA from a regular expression
- NFA: epsilon-closures
- DFA: minimization using Table-filling algorithm, convert from NFA to DFA.
- Context-free grammars: CYK algorithm



##To do

- Push-down automata
- And more!


Feel free to add more algorithms or refactor existing ones!
